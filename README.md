# Project 1 - Employee Reimbursement System
Rudimentary example of JDBC communication with the front end. The purpose of this project is to create a web site where Managers and Employees can login, view submitted requests based on permissions, and in the Manager's case, approve or deny stored requests. This is a one-person project that was created for training purposes while at Revature.
